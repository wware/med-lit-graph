## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem: Diagnostic Detectives vs. Clinical Reality

My partner's doctor spent **weeks** being a diagnostic detective—manually correlating obscure symptoms across dozens of medical papers, following citation trails, cross-referencing contradictory studies, and synthesizing evidence from disparate sources to find the right diagnosis. It worked, but most doctors don't have that time or tenacity.

**The result**: Patients with complex or rare conditions suffer with wrong diagnoses for years.

### Existing Tools Fall Short

**PubMed** has 35+ million citations, but search is keyword-based. You can't ask:
- "What diseases cause fatigue, joint pain, AND butterfly rash together?"
- "What genes increase breast cancer risk AND have FDA-approved drugs?"
- "How does metformin → AMPK → glucose metabolism work?"

**UpToDate** offers expert-curated summaries, but:
- Human curation is slow (months to update)
- Doesn't excel at rare/complex multi-symptom diagnostics
- No programmatic access for multi-hop reasoning

**Google Scholar** finds papers but doesn't understand relationships between entities across papers.

### What This Project Does Differently

**Multi-hop graph queries with full provenance**—the kind of research that takes clinicians weeks can happen in milliseconds:

```python
# Question: "Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's via protein targets"
# PubMed: 🤷 (keyword search won't find this path)
# This system: ✅ Graph traversal finds the connection

query = {
  "find": "paths",
  "path_pattern": {
    "start": {"node_type": "disease", "name": "Alzheimer disease"},
    "edges": [
      {"edge": {"relation_type": "associated_with"}, "node": {"node_type": "gene"}},
      {"edge": {"relation_type": "encodes"}, "node": {"node_type": "protein"}},
      {"edge": {"relation_type": "binds_to", "direction": "incoming"},
       "node": {"node_type": "drug", "properties": {"fda_approved": true}}}
    ]
  }
}
# Returns: FDA-approved drugs targeting proteins linked to Alzheimer's
# With full citation trail showing each connection
```

**Every result includes**:
- PMC paper IDs for verification
- Section locations (results vs. discussion)
- Study quality (RCT vs. case report)
- Confidence scores based on evidence strength
- Contradictory evidence when it exists

### The Value Proposition

This isn't about replacing doctors—it's about giving them **superpowers for the hard cases**:

- **Rare disease diagnosis**: Correlate obscure symptom patterns across thousands of papers instantly
- **Drug repurposing**: Find FDA-approved drugs for new indications via graph traversal
- **Evidence synthesis**: Aggregate contradictory studies with quality weighting
- **Pharmacovigilance**: Track drug interactions across the full corpus
- **Research acceleration**: Literature reviews that take weeks → seconds

**Built on free, public data (PubMed/PMC)** with transparent, reproducible graph construction.

**Target users**: Physicians and researchers who need to answer complex questions that existing tools can't handle.

## Quick Example

**Question**: "What drugs treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer?"

**Python**:
```python
import os
from medgraph import MedicalGraphClient

# The client will use the MEDGRAPH_SERVER environment variable.
client = MedicalGraphClient(os.getenv("MEDGRAPH_SERVER"))
results = client.find_treatments("BRCA-mutated breast cancer")

for drug in results.results:
    print(f"{drug['name']}: {drug['paper_count']} papers, {drug['avg_confidence']:.2f} confidence")
    print(f"  Evidence: {drug['source_papers'][0]}")  # PMC ID with full trace
```

**curl**:
```bash
curl -X POST $MEDGRAPH_SERVER/api/v1/query -d '{
  "find": "nodes",
  "node_pattern": {"node_type": "drug"},
  "edge_pattern": {"relation_type": "treats", "min_confidence": 0.7},
  "filters": [{"field": "target.name", "operator": "contains", "value": "BRCA"}]
}'
```

Every result includes PMC paper IDs, section locations, and extraction methods so doctors can verify the claims.

## Design Principles

### 1. Provenance is Mandatory

**Every medical claim must be traceable.**

```python
# ❌ This FAILS validation - no evidence
treats = Treats(
    subject_id="RxNorm:1187832",  # Olaparib
    object_id="UMLS:C0006142",    # Breast Cancer
    response_rate=0.59
)

# ✅ This WORKS - evidence required
treats = Treats(
    subject_id="RxNorm:1187832",
    object_id="UMLS:C0006142",
    evidence=[
        Evidence(
            paper_id="PMC999888",
            section_type="results",
            paragraph_idx=8,
            extraction_method="table_parser",
            confidence=0.92,
            study_type="rct",
            sample_size=302
        )
    ],
    response_rate=0.59
)
```

**Why this matters**:
- Doctors can click through to verify claims
- Researchers can audit data quality
- System filters by study quality (RCTs vs case reports)
- Confidence scores are evidence-based, not arbitrary

### 2. Immutable JSON Source of Truth

Graph databases can corrupt. Algorithms improve. Papers get retracted.

**Solution**: Per-paper JSON files are immutable source of truth.
- Graph database regenerates from JSON
- Paper retracted? Remove JSON, rebuild graph
- Better NER model? Re-process, regenerate graph

**Trade-off**: Extra storage (~1-5MB per paper) for complete reproducibility.

### 3. Vendor-Neutral Query Language

Different graph databases use different query languages (Cypher, Gremlin, SPARQL).

**Solution**: JSON query language that translates to any backend.

```json
{
  "find": "paths",
  "path_pattern": {
    "start": {"node_type": "disease", "name": "Alzheimer disease"},
    "edges": [
      {"edge": {"relation_type": "associated_with"}, "node": {"node_type": "gene"}},
      {"edge": {"relation_type": "encodes"}, "node": {"node_type": "protein"}},
      {"edge": {"relation_type": "binds_to", "direction": "incoming"},
       "node": {"node_type": "drug"}}
    ]
  }
}
```

Translates to openCypher (Neptune), Cypher (Neo4j), or Gremlin.

**Benefits**:
- LLM-friendly (JSON is easy for AI to generate)
- Database-agnostic (switch backends without rewriting queries)
- Human-readable
- Programmatically composable

### 4. Evidence Quality Weighting

Not all studies are equal. RCTs > observational studies > case reports.

**Automatic quality weighting**:
```python
study_weights = {
    'rct': 1.0,              # Gold standard
    'meta_analysis': 0.95,
    'cohort': 0.8,
    'observational': 0.6,
    'case_report': 0.4
}
```

Confidence scores = weighted average of evidence quality.

### 5. Graph RAG (Not Just Vector Search)

Pure vector search misses multi-hop connections. Pure graph misses semantic similarity.

**Hybrid approach**:
1. **Vector search**: Find relevant papers semantically
2. **Graph traversal**: Discover multi-hop relationships
3. **Combine**: Rank by both relevance and graph structure

**Example**: "Drugs for BRCA-mutated breast cancer"
- Vector: Find papers about BRCA, breast cancer, treatments
- Graph: BRCA1 → increases_risk → breast cancer → treated_by → olaparib
- Result: Drugs with evidence for BRCA-mutated subtype specifically

## Schema

### Entity Types
- **Medical**: disease, symptom, drug, gene, protein, pathway, biomarker, test, procedure
- **Research**: paper, author, institution, clinical_trial

### Relationship Types
- **Causal**: causes, prevents, increases_risk, decreases_risk
- **Treatment**: treats, manages, contraindicates, side_effect
- **Biological**: encodes, binds_to, inhibits, activates, upregulates, downregulates
- **Clinical**: diagnoses, indicates, precedes, associated_with
- **Provenance**: cites, studied_in, authored_by

Every medical relationship includes:
```python
class MedicalRelationship:
    evidence: list[Evidence]  # MANDATORY, min_length=1
    confidence: float          # Auto-calculated from evidence
    source_papers: list[str]   # Auto-populated
    contradicted_by: list[str] # Track conflicts
```

## Query Language

### Simple Node Query
```json
{
  "find": "nodes",
  "node_pattern": {"node_type": "drug"},
  "edge_pattern": {"relation_type": "treats"},
  "filters": [{"field": "target.name", "operator": "eq", "value": "diabetes"}]
}
```

### Multi-Hop Path Query

    "edges": [
      {"edge": {"relation_type": "symptom_of"}, "node": {"node_type": "disease"}}
    ]
  },
  "aggregate": {
    "group_by": ["disease.name"],
    "aggregations": {"symptom_count": ["count", "symptom.name"]}
  }
}
```

### Evidence Quality Filtering
```json
{
  "edge_pattern": {"relation_type": "treats", "min_confidence": 0.8},
  "filters": [

## Client Libraries

### Python
```bash
pip install medgraph-client
```

```python
import os
from medgraph import MedicalGraphClient, QueryBuilder

# The client will use the MEDGRAPH_SERVER environment variable.
client = MedicalGraphClient(os.getenv("MEDGRAPH_SERVER"))

# High-level convenience methods
treatments = client.find_treatments("diabetes")
genes = client.find_disease_genes("Alzheimer disease")
tests = client.find_diagnostic_tests("lupus")

# Custom queries with builder
query = (QueryBuilder()
    .find_nodes("gene")
    .with_edge("associated_with", min_confidence=0.7)
    .filter_target("disease", name="breast cancer")
    .aggregate(["gene.name"], paper_count=("count", "rel.evidence.paper_id"))
    .limit(20)
    .build())

results = client.execute(query)
```

<!-- TODO files don't exist: [Python docs →](client/python/) | [API reference →](client/python/api.md) -->

### TypeScript/JavaScript
```bash
npm install @medgraph/client
```

```typescript
import { MedicalGraphClient, QueryBuilder, EntityType, RelationType } from '@medgraph/client';

const client = new MedicalGraphClient();

const treatments = await client.findTreatments('diabetes');

const query = new QueryBuilder()
  .findNodes(EntityType.GENE)
  .withEdge(RelationType.ASSOCIATED_WITH, { minConfidence: 0.7 })
  .filterTarget(EntityType.DISEASE, { name: 'breast cancer' })
  .build();

const results = await client.execute(query);
```

<!-- TODO files don't exist: [TypeScript docs →](client/typescript/) | [API reference →](client/typescript/api.md) -->

### MCP Server (for LLMs)

Enable Claude, ChatGPT, or other AI assistants to query medical knowledge:

```bash
npm install -g @medgraph/mcp-server
```

**Claude Desktop config** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "medgraph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@medgraph/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MEDGRAPH_API_URL": "${MEDGRAPH_SERVER}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now ask Claude:
> "What drugs treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer? Show me the evidence."

Claude will query the graph and cite specific papers.
