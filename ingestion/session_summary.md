# Last Session Note (January 7, 2026)

The agent encountered persistent issues accessing files outside its constrained working directory `/home/wware/med-lit-graph/ingestion`, even with symbolic links. The user will restart the IDE from the parent directory (`/home/wware/med-lit-graph`) to resolve this.

The agent's last action was to try and modify `schema/entity_sqlmodel.py` after being provided its content. This modification will be re-attempted once the directory access issue is resolved.
